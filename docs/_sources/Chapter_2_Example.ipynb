    "# Sumerian Networks JupyterBook\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the Sumerian Network project has been to build reproducible socio-economic networks from the Ur III archives, and to further refine these models to more accurately reflect the actors and entities active in these unprovenanced archives over the c. 80 year period in the 21st century BCE. Beginning with ca. 15,000 transliterated texts from the site of Drehem (known in antiquity as Puzriš-Dagān), this JupyterBook has a linear progression which applies various tools and methods in NLP and Open Science. In order to make our study reproducible, we used Jupyter Notebooks (hosted in a [GitHub repository]()) to describe the tools and methods we use in connection with the code and dataset, which result in a series of empirical network models. \n",
